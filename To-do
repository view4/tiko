Things for us still to be doing: 

Convert to redux: 
	- I think it would be a good thing for us to learn. 
		- it's usually good to learn
	- I think it may be abit difficult, and a way to make it even better portfolio wise than the to-do app 
	- I think it would make it easier to manage a lot of the data flow. 
	- Should make state and props more accessible. 
		- probably a goood thing to be doing before it gets too big. 

Link to firebase: 
	- easier than setting up backend. 
	- Also a good thing to be using. 
	- Can provide live notifications. 
	- Better way to mange the data 
	--> Therefore we may have to think carefully about what kind of data we want to hold for each person etc..

Improve UX/UI/design (continuous): 
	- Perhaps we could ask Ivan to help with this (esp. if he is looking for such positions)
	- Design is something I'm bad at would like to improve. 
	- Ruins the feel of the app otherwise.
	- especially if we put on our portfolio it should be something which we are kind of happy to show other people. 


Perhaps we could refine/ review the code a bit: 
	- improve readibility and usability. 
	- Good practice, a chance to learn. 
	- Probs good if we build on top of what we have.
